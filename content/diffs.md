# Known Discrepancies

We have compiled this Bill of Material from various sources:

* An original Commodore Amiga 4000 "Bill of Materials" document
* Actual Amiga 4000 mainboards
* AmigaWiki: [A4000 Rev B Schematics](http://www.amigawiki.de/dnl/schematics/A4000_Rb.pdf)
* Acill: [A4000 Replica Project](https://github.com/Acill/A4000RevB)
* [Amiga PCB explorer](https://www.amigapcb.org/)
* Chucky: [Component Locator, A4000 RevB - Acill](http://locator.reamiga.info/locator.php?project=A4000)

These sources are not consistent, and we have found a few minor discrepancies.

**We preferred the values of the actual mainboards and the Commodore Bill of Materials over values found in newer sources.**

If you are using this list to repair an old Amiga, you should always prefer the type that you found on the board. After all, the machine was already working with that value.

## List of Known Discrepancies

This is an (incomplete) list of discrepancies between these sources. They may not necessarily be improvements, but could just be typos or copying errors. It is up to you whether you prefer the original values or the modified ones.

* ER475: Some sources use an 68Ω resistor
* R520-R543: The AmigaWiki schematics use 68Ω resistors
