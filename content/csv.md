# Mouser CSV Export

For your convenience, we offer a CSV export of the parts that are available at [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com).

Copy the CSV below to your clipboard, and paste it into a text editor or spreadsheet tool. There you can modify the CSV, change quantities or remove parts that you already have. After that, [upload the CSV](https://www.mouser.com/Bom/Upload) to create a Bill of Material in your customer account. The original Commodore part numbers are retained, so you will find them printed on the component bags later.

## Before You Start…

* **Have you gathered the <span class="rare">Rare</span> parts already?** The parts on this list will be useless without them.
* **This list is not complete!** It only contains the standard components that are sold by Mouser Electronics. You will have to find other sources for the rest. We cannot assist you there.
* **Do not blindly order this list, but scrutinize every part first!** Even though the choice of parts _should_ be correct, they have not been proven yet to actually work on an assembled Amiga board.
* **The choice of parts is only meant to be an example.** There may cheaper or better suited alternatives.
* **Mind the graduated prices.** The quantities in this list are the exact amounts needed to assemble the board. Ordering larger quantities may be cheaper. It's also good to have a few parts as spare.
* **Some parts are replacements** because the original parts have been discontinued. They do not meet the original specifications and thus may cause problems.
* **Some parts are optional.** Check if you need them.
